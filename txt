Design part 
AutoDesk Fusion360 
Sliser: FlashPrint 
Setting up the printer Creator 3
Settings check and getting it ready for print

For design We implemented Autodesk Fusion 360. tHE INSTALLATION IS pretty straight forward: 
Follow this link for reference 

For printing a solid model we need sliced that makes a solid model sliced layer by layer making it ready to print through the printer
Here in this case we are using Cteator 3 as printer. 
Just to note down: All the printing setting e.g. Setting platform and extruder temperature need to be set through the slicer 

In terms of Getting the printer ready for print we need to make sure
-Calibration is done 
-Selection and management of extruder and fillament 
-Printing settings are set as desired
-The platform is clean to start printing

When the printer is ready what we need to do is to get the solid model (stl, STEP, obj) imported into sliser (FlashPrint inthis case) and 
get converted into .gx before transfering the same to the printer to print.
